--------------
  * Added option for hiding/showing the auth chain
  * Fixed bug #1: The severities of Zabbix triggers are now supported.
  * Updated the preferences window for easing the setting of monitoring settings

2.1.0beta1
--------------
  * Added support for Zabbix: Requires Zabbix >= 1.7. 
    Known Issues: the severities of triggers are not yet taken into account. 
    All problems are simply reported. This will be fixed before the stable 
    release (ticket #1). 

  * Released the UI Module and the Daemon Module as seperate packages. 
    The UI Module became 'RealOpInsight' while the Daemon Module, specific 
    to Nagios, is now called 'Daemon Service for Nagios'.

  * VERY IMPORTANT: To support both Zabbix and Nagios without additional 
    configuration constraints for the administrators, the format of configuration 
    files has been modified to detect automatically the target monitoring system 
    at the loading time. Nevertheless, for backward compatibility, the former 
    format is still supported and detected as compatible with Nagios. 
    It's recommended to upgrade the format of your former configuration files: just 
    open the each file from the Editor and resave it (File -> Save).

  * Changed of the format of message exchanges between the Daemon 
    Service for Nagios and the Operations Consoles for better 
    performance and better performance and more flexibility. It's 
    required to upgrade the Daemon Service towards the version 1.1.0.

  * Bug fix: Added more robustness in the communications to prevent situations 
    of infinite waiting when the Daemon Service for Nagios does not respond.

  * Bug fix: minor changes on the management of update interval.

  * Bug fix: fixed the problem when the native check field appears empty when there 
    is no Nagios status file loaded.

  * Deprecated command: 'ngrt4n', now use 'ngrt4n-manager' instead.

  * The Windows Installer has been tested on Windows 7 and Windows 8. 
    Please remove any older version of NGRT4N before installing RealOpInsight.
